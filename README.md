### 🚀 Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on, showcasing my skills in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science:

* **[UNET Improvement by Supervised Contrastive Learning for Medical Image Segmentation]**:
    * **Description**: My project during research at Kyungpook National University focused on developing a novel Class-Balanced Contrastive Loss to improve the UNET performance by pre-training using a semi-supervised contrastive learning technique.
    * **Technologies Used**: `Python`, `TensorFlow`, `OpenCV`, `numpy` (or relevant tools).
    * **Key Features/Learnings**: Model performance increased from around 80% to around 90%.
    * **[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Moringa007/multiclasses-segmentation)**

* **[Receipt Scanner]**:
    * **Description**: A web-based application that uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to scan and extract itemized data from receipts. Upload images or capture photos directly from your webcam to automatically parse receipt information, including items, prices, and totals.
    * **Features**:
      - **Image Upload**: Upload receipt images from your device
      - **Webcam Capture**: Take photos of the receipt directly using the device's camera
      - **OCR Processing**: Extract text using Tesseract OCR
      - **Smart Parsing**: Automatically identify items, prices, quantities, and totals
      - **Image Enhancement**: Automatic image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
      - **Data Storage**: Store receipts and items in a database
      - **Web Interface**: Clean, responsive we interface
      - **Export Data**: Download extracted data as JSON
    * **Technologies Used**: `Python`, `Tesseract OCR engine`, `OpenCV`.
    * **Key Features/Learnings**: Modern web browser with camera support (for webcam feature).
    * **[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Moringa007/receipt_scanner.git)**
